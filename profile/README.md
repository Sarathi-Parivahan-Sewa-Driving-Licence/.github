In India, the process of getting a driving licence is an important task for anyone who wants to drive legally. Sarathi Parivahan Sewa is an online service offered by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways (MoRTH) that allows people to apply for and manage their driving licences. The platform has made the process much easier, as applicants can now complete many steps online without needing to visit the Regional Transport Office (RTO) in person. This article will explain how you can apply for a driving licence, check its status, and understand the various services provided through Sarathi Parivahan Sewa.

## 1. Introduction to Sarathi Parivahan Sewa

Sarathi Parivahan Sewa is an online service that helps citizens of India access and manage transport-related services. The platform is part of the government's digital initiative to make the process of obtaining and renewing driving licences simpler and more efficient. Sarathi allows users to apply for a new driving licence, renew an existing one, and perform other related tasks, all through an online portal.

This online service is designed to reduce the time and effort involved in the traditional RTO process. It is available in all states and union territories in India, though there may be some variations depending on local regulations. The platform is designed to be user-friendly, so even people with limited technical knowledge can use it without difficulty.

## 2. Types of Driving Licences

Before we dive into the application process, it's important to understand the different types of driving licences issued by the government:

- **Learner's Licence**: A Learner's Licence (LL) is the first step in getting a driving licence. It is issued to individuals who are learning to drive and need to practice before applying for a full driving licence.
- **Permanent Driving Licence**: After holding a Learner's Licence for a specific period (usually 30 days), individuals can apply for a permanent driving licence. This requires passing a driving test at the RTO.
- **Commercial Driving Licence**: This is for individuals who wish to drive commercial vehicles, such as trucks, buses, or taxis. The requirements are different from those of a regular driving licence and may include additional training and tests.
- **International Driving Permit**: This licence is for those who wish to drive in foreign countries. It is valid in multiple countries and serves as an official translation of the Indian driving licence.

### Step 1: Visit the Sarathi Parivahan Sewa Portal

The first thing you need to do is visit the official Sarathi Parivahan Sewa website. The link is [https://parivahan.gov.in](https://parivahan.gov.in), which will redirect you to the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways' portal. You can access this website from any device that has an internet connection.

### Step 2: Select Your State

Once you reach the Sarathi Parivahan homepage, you will see a list of services available. Choose the state or union territory where you reside. This is important because the rules and requirements for driving licences may vary from state to state.

### Step 3: Choose the Service You Need

Once you have selected your state, the website will show you various services available, such as:

- Apply for a new Driving Licence

- Learner’s Licence application
- Check Driving Licence Status

Click on the option that suits your needs.

### Step 4: Register on the Portal

If this is your first time using the portal, you will need to create an account. To do so, you will have to fill out a registration form with details such as your name, contact information, and Aadhaar number. The Aadhaar number is required to verify your identity.

### Step 5: Fill Out the Application Form

After registering, you will need to fill out an application form for a driving licence. This form requires you to provide your personal details, address, and any relevant medical information. You will also need to upload scanned copies of required documents such as:

- Proof of identity (Aadhaar card, passport, voter ID, etc.)
- Proof of address (electricity bill, ration card, bank statement, etc.)
- Passport-size photographs

Make sure to check the document requirements for your state, as they may differ slightly.

### Step 6: Schedule a Driving Test (If Applicable)

If you are applying for a permanent driving licence (and not a learner’s licence), you will need to schedule a driving test. The portal will allow you to choose a date and time for the test at your nearest RTO. Some states may also offer an option for a "Test Slot" where you can check availability and choose the most convenient time.

### Step 7: Payment of Fees

After filling out the application form and uploading the required documents, you will be asked to pay the application fee. The fee can usually be paid online using various payment methods such as debit/credit cards, net banking, or UPI. The fee amount will vary depending on the type of licence you are applying for.

### Step 8: Submit the Application

Once all the information is filled out and the payment is made, you can submit your application. You will receive an application reference number, which you can use to track the status of your application.

## 4. How to Check the Status of Your Driving Licence Application

After applying for your driving licence, you may want to check its status. The Sarathi Parivahan Sewa portal allows you to do this online.

### Step 1: Visit the Sarathi Parivahan Sewa Website

Go to the same website, [https://parivahan.gov.in](https://parivahan.gov.in), and select the state in which you applied for the licence.

### Step 2: Choose the "Check Application Status" Option

Look for the “Check Driving Licence Status” or "Application Status" option. This will take you to a page where you can track the progress of your application.

### Step 3: Enter Your Details

You will be asked to enter your application number or the reference number you received when you submitted your application. Some states may also ask for additional details like your date of birth or Aadhaar number.

### Step 4: View Your Status

Once you have entered the required information, click on the "Submit" button. The system will display the current status of your application. You will be able to see whether your application is under review, whether the driving test has been scheduled, or if the licence has been issued.
